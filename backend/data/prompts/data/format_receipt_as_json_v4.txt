Extract data strictly from the receipt text. Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no comments, no code blocks) that matches this schema:

{"merchant_name":"string|null","total_amount":number,"currency":"string","line_items":[{"name":"string","quantity":number,"unit_price":number,"total_price":number}],"metadata":{"address":"string|null","tax_id":"string|null","cashier":"string|null","payment_method":"string|null"}}

STRICT RULES:
- Extract values EXACTLY as written. Do not calculate, correct, infer, or guess any numbers.
- Never compute total_price, quantity, or unit_price. Use only the numbers explicitly visible.
- If a number is ambiguous (e.g., "1 464", "1  964", "1.208 × 28.96"), keep it EXACT as shown and do not try to correct its decimal format.
- If total_price is not printed, set it to null.
- If quantity or unit_price is unclear, set them to null.
- Do not fix math errors from the receipt. Incorrect totals must remain incorrect.
- Do not merge numbers from different lines. Only connect values clearly belonging to the same item.
- Do not change decimal separators. If OCR shows "34 91" or "28,96", keep it as-is.
- currency: extract from text (LEI/EUR/USD/etc).
- total_amount: extract the final paid amount only.
- metadata fields: extract if they appear, otherwise null.

Output must be valid JSON and must NOT include any text before or after the JSON.
